ðŸ”¹ Create a parent component and in its state store the array of names (strings). Initial value - `["First", "Second"]`  
ðŸ”¹ Create a child component with the following props
```ts
interface ChildProps {
    name: string;
    index: number;
    onChange: (index: number, newName: string) => void;
    onDelete: (index: number) => void;
}
```
ðŸ”¹ Parent component should render child components (each child component responsible for rendering one name) and a button, which, when clicked, will add new name at the end. It should pass required props to child components and the passed functions must behave as their names suggest.  
ðŸ”¹ Child component should render controllable input with explicit value passed from parent. Changing input value must call `onChange` function (received from props) with appropriate arguments. Render button for deleting too.  
ðŸ”¹ Make sure that changing value of single name rerenders only parent and corresponding child component

The problem is same as MNA.1, except:  
ðŸ”¹ Use uncontrollable input in child component. That is, instead of passing value to input, pass defaultValue.  
ðŸ”¹ Notice the bug when deleting non-last child component.  
ðŸ”¹ Resolve the bug. You are not allowed to change the types of ChildProps or names (string[]). However, you are free to introduce new states (or properties in state in case of class components).

## (MNA.3) Managing arrays of more general child components

The problem is same as MNA.1, except:  
ðŸ”¹ the props of child component. The new type should be
```ts
interface ChildProps {
    name: string;
    onChange: (newName: string) => void;
    onDelete: () => void;
}
```
ðŸ”¹ Try achieving the desired results *without* considering the optimization (of rerendering only the appropriate components).  
ðŸ”¹ Finally, try achieving desired result with optimizing rerendering as described in MNA.1.
